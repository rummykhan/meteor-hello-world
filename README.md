# Meteor Hello World

Learning Meteor was in my `ASAP To Do List`.
Thanks to <a href="//github.com/moeen-basra">Moeen Basra</a> for teaching and guiding through this.

This is just a hello-world repository.
Created by following the tutorial from <a href="https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app">Official Meteor React JS Hello World</a>
